This is a small tutorial, where I try out git. 
I was inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE
To do
I will look at the commands 
add done single, poem anterior, .
status done
checkout done branch jump and timetravel
branch done list and creation
log done
init done
config done user name and email
merge done 

If you get stuck in log, press 'q' for 'quit' and 'ENTER'

Commits 
git commit -m "message" works for quick fixes. Simply typing 'git commit' allows one to write more clear description. One done in git commit, "Press Esc and then type :wq to save and exit." (Stephen Amaza)
